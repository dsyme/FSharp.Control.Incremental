// This example outlines one possible way of interoperating with
// event-based systems and imperatively keeping an output up-to-date.
// Please note that this kind of adapter code tends to get dirty and 
// there may be better ways for doing this (depending on the concrete use-case).
// However the pattern outlined below is used in Aardvark.Rendering and Aardvark.UI 
// for keeping mutable datastructures in sync with our system's state.
//
// As a basic example we're gonna build an adapter for adaptively listing a directory
// and writing operations to the console. 
// Of course this could easier be done without adaptive system but that's not the point here.
